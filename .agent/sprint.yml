# This file is the single source of truth for development progress.
# The dev agent MUST update this file after completing each story.
#
# Status values:
#   not-started  → Work has not begun
#   in-progress  → Agent is actively working on this
#   done         → Code merged to dev, tests passing
#   review       → Epic complete, awaiting human review
#
# PRD+ Impact:
#   Stories marked with (PRD+) are new or modified based on docs/prd-plus.md
#   and docs/success-metrics.md. See Section 8 of prd-plus.md for mapping.
#
# The agent reads this file to know:
#   1. What to work on next (first "not-started" story in current sprint)
#   2. What's already done (avoid re-doing work)
#   3. Where to find story details (file path)
